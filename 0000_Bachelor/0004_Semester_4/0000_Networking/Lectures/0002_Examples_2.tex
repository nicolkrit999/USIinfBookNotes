\chapter{Known Bugs}

\section{Introduction}
Nothing is bugs-free. There are some known bugs which I don't have incentive to solve, or it is hard to solve whatsoever. Let me list some of them.

\subsection{Footnote Environment}
It's easy to let you fall into a situation that you want to keep using \texttt{footnote} to add a bunch of unrelated stuffs. However, with our environment there is a known strange behavior, which is following.
\begin{eg}
	Footnote!\footnote{This is a footnote!}
	\begin{remark}
		Oops! footnote somehow shows up earlier than expect!\footnote{This is another footnote!}
	\end{remark}

	Bugs caught!\footnote{The final footnote which is ok!}
\end{eg}

As we saw, the footnote in the \texttt{Example} environment should show at the bottom of its own box, but it's caught by \texttt{Remark} which causes the unwanted behavior. Unfortunately, I haven't found a nice way to solve this. A potential way to solve this is by using \texttt{footnotemark} with \texttt{footnotetext} placing at the bottom of the environment, but this is tedious and needs lots of manual tweaking.

Furthermore, not sure whether you notice it or not, but the color box of \texttt{Remark} is not quite right! It extends to the right, another trick bug...

\subsection{Mdframe Environment}
Though \texttt{mdframe} package is nice and is the key theme throughout this template, but it has some kind of weird behavior. Let's see the demo.

\begin{proof}[Proof of \autoref{thm}]
	We need to prove the followings.
	\begin{claim}
		\(E = mc^{2} \).
	\end{claim}
	\begin{explanation}

		Nonsense.

		Nonsense,

		Nonsense,

		Nonsense,

		Nonsense,

		Nonsense.
	\end{explanation}

\end{proof}

I expect it should break much earlier, and this seems to be an \href{https://github.com/marcodaniel/mdframed/issues/9}{algorithmic issue} of \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/mdframed?lang=en}{\texttt{mdframe}}. One potential solution is to use \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/tcolorbox?lang=en}{\texttt{tcolorbox}} instead, but I haven't completely figure it out, hence I can't really say anything right now.
